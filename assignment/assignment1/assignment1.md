## Scale Models and Idealized Models ... and Others

### Understanding models
- Represent real-world things

#### Ontology: What is a model?

Elements of models:

- Physical objects
- Fictional and abstract objects (i.e., heuristics) != "False"
- Set theoretic objects--relationships to the world (e.g., social network)
- Description and equation objects--semantic description of an object

#### Epistemology: How does a model work?

- The role of fictional and abstract models (e.g., "thought experiments")
- Computer simulations help figure epistemological models (e.g., deep learning and hypermarameter optimization)
- Conumdrum of explanations... how do you explain how things are related to each other? Theory vs. Grounded theory. Realistic > Idealistic model --> explainability
- Idealistic models help understand the real world-- if else helps understand cause and effect. see thought experiment as above. Ideal gas example.
- 

### Scale models
- Naturalistic, truthful mirrow image of the target phenomenon but it is not the vacuum-sealed true model that represents every aspect of the target phenomenon

### Idealized models
- Simplification or distortion likely bc the real-life system is too complex
- Good example is that people behave rationally at all times
- Aristotelian idealization (simplification) vs. Galilean idealization (distortion)
- Approximation is the key characteristic

### Other models

#### Analog models
- Similar enough to target system but contain different elements, structured

#### Toy models
- An extreme type of Idealized model, extreme simplification or distortion; no nuances or details

#### Minimal models
- Extreme simplification, related to Toy models; no real overlap between reality and model

#### Phenomenological models
- Has only observable elements of the real world; ignores unseen forces

#### Data models
- Idealized version of data collected from immediate observation (i.e., raw data)

#### Interpretive models
See below

#### Substitute models
See below

### Relationship between models and theory
- Interpretive models: Data (<)-> Model <-> Theory
- Substitute models: Data (<)-> Model
