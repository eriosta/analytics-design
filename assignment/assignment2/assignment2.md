Exercise #2

Name:



Having talked about privacy and big data, let’s see how US adult consumers feel about it.  This exercise utilizes the 2015 National Consumer Survey.  The data is available in Excel, SPSS and SAS formats.  You should be able to get at it from one of these forms and move it to whatever platform you want.  Here are the instructions for this exercise.


1.	Create a bar graph that displays the data for the variable commodity – this variable represents how consumers feel about their willingness to provide personal data for something of value.  What does the bar graph tell you in general?


2.	Create a bar graph that displays the data for the variable like_know – this variable represents the extent to which consumers would like to know how their data is being used.  What does the bar graph tell you in general?


3.	Perform the appropriate statistical test to see whether or not men and women differ in terms of how they feel about exchanging their personal data for something of value.  Interpret what you found – be sure to comment on the magnitude of any differences you find.

4.	Perform the appropriate statistical test to see whether or not people who drink coca cola differ in terms of how they feel about knowing how their data is being used.    Interpret what you found – be sure to comment on the magnitude of any differences you find.
