# Assignment 3: Survival Analysis

1.	 You are analyzing a 16 day study of patients who have Krusty the Clown disease.  Your data includes a subject ID, their survival time and a status.  A status of 0 means they are alive while a status of 1 means they died of the disease.  
a.	Construct a survival table similar to the one in the lecture for the data.  You will show your work within the table – if there is some division like 1/5 then show that like 1/5=.2 and if there is some multiplication then show the numbers being multiplied and the result  e.g.  .1 * 4 =0.4
b.	Plot a survival curve for the probabilities you generate in part a.



2.	You are studying three different new drugs that may help slow the progress of La Traviata disease which compels people to sing opera until they exhaust themselves and die.  Do the following:
a.	Draw a survival plot that shows the survival curves for all three drugs.
b.	Test to see if overall there is an effect of any of the drugs on survival taken as a global set.
c.	Compare the survival curves for each of the three drugs with each other (three comparisons) and see if any if the curves are different from each other.  Note that you should be sure to adjust for multiple group comparisons.

The data for question 2 can be found on the next pages.  You are free to use whatever platform you want – Python, R, SAS, Stata, SPSS, etc.  except no Excel – I hate Excel!  

Be sure to include your answers to question 2, your output and code!
Data for part 2 of exercise #3.  Data format is Group#  time  event (0=no event, 1=event)
