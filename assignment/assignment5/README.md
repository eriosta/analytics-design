This exercise will cover some of the basics in dealing with missing data.  The data set is presented to you in this exercise as the last pages.  

1.	Produce means and standard deviations in a table for the five variables in the data set.

2.	Replace the missing values for all the variables in the data set using the mean substitution method.  Place that table here…

3.	Compare the means and standard deviations from the original data set table with the mean substitution table.  What should happen to the means?  What should happen to the standard deviations?

4.	Run one simple non-multiple imputation models (e.g. just a simple regression model) –  for v3_miss.  Be sure to replace the missing values in v3_miss with the predicted values from the regression.  (I shortened this to just one variable – too much work otherwise I think).

5.	Compare the table of means and standard deviations from the original data set to the one constructed in step 4 above.  What do you see?


6.	Run a multiple (multivariate?) imputation model on the five variables – you can pick from multiple imputation regression, mcmc or any other flavor.

7.	Compare the table of means and standard deviations from step 6 with the original data set.  What do you expect?  What do you actually see?

8.	For an extra 8 points extra credit, produce a missing values matrix like the one shown in class.  You can use SAS or name your poison in terms of platform as long as it produces a similar matrix.
